# cs210

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. - The real world application of this project was being able to take in a file that was filled with unique data, read it, present it in a couple different ways, and then export it.

What did you do particularly well? - I personally think I did my histogram well, I think there were a lot of longer and harder ways of producing it ( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-program-to-draw-a-histogram/ ). I streamlined the process and made it much simpler. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? - Well I could do more input validation. Maybe a couple do-while loops would help with this. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? - I wrote Java for two years at a top 10 bank as a Jr. Dev. And I have spent the past two years at 3M writing C#. I think my issue with C++ is the lack of memory management. Like okay it has a lot of great libraries and integration, but it also has horribly annoying syntax. I definitely used a lot of documentation this course. ( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170 )

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? - This is not my first time taking this course, so I know that I will be using more C++ in various projects and classes. I think the bigger take away with the logic, being able to logically step through a project to see how the code is working is very important. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? - I added in line notes, I also used pretty standardized naming conventions. I tried to follow normal documentation. The worst coder you know is you 6 months ago. I don’t think there will be any major changes to the syntax or language so I don’t have to worry about those things, the most important part is documentation and in line commenting.
